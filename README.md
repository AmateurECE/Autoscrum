# Overview #

Autoscrum is an automated task management and project planning system which is
based on the Agile Scrum work management and software development framework.
Its purpose is to perform some of the duties of the Scrum Master and Project
Owner, offloading a lot of these responsibilities from you (the Developer), and
thereby streamlining the development process.

The idea for this program came to me while I was at work, working on one of my
stories. I plan to use it to help me prioritize myself when working on personal
projects--I'm only one person, so it's pretty difficult to be Project Owner and
Scrum Master and Development Team all at the same time.

# Workflow #

This project is currently WIP. Many of the documents I use to plan the
architecture of the program or plan my execution will be published here.
