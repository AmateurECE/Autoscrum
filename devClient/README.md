## Development Client ##

This is a barebones client for the Autoscrum Server. This client is not meant
to be utilized by an end user, and it will more than likely be removed once
development of the Server has completed.

### What It Has ###

Not. Much. This client has no login or session functionality (yet). It does not
perform command or syntax checking, and it exposes functionality of the server
that will not be accessible to the end user.
